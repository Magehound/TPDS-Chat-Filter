Using the script as a JavaScript bookmark

Fast and lightweight way to run the script.

Go to the bookmark menu of your browser and add a new bookmark with the title of your choice.

Copy the following snippet and paste it into the URL-Field: javascript:(function(){document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('script')).src='http://magehound.github.io/TPDS-Chat-Filter/chat_filter.user.js';})();

Save the Bookmark.

From now on, you can just click on that bookmark when you have the TPDS-Tab open to enable the script.
